# Life Clock

According to the Wikipedia, today, the average life expectancy of humans has reached 79 years old. That means we have a lot of time to find the meaning of life. However, are you really taking advantage of the current time or just wasting life? How much time do you still have in your life? That's why I want to creat this project, using precise numbers to remind people of the truth of life.

This project aims to build an individial life resume, users first need to enter their birthday.

Then we will:

  ·According to the current date，calculate the age in precise days.

  ·Point out the expectancy of human life.

  ·Calculate the percentage of the life time that has been used.

  ·Divide users into different groups based on age, then for young people, young people, middle-aged people, 
   and the elderly, giving some usful suggestions for life.

Next we need users to think their plan of this year：

  ·According to the current date，Point out how many days are left this year.

  ·Suggest the user to formulate this year's plan.

And their plans for the next few years.

Finally, output the individial life resume and urge users to cherish the current time and complete their plans.
