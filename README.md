# EE551project

According to the Wikipedia, today, the average life expectancy of humans has reached 79 years old. That means we have a lot of time to find the meaning of life. However, are you really taking advantage of the current time or just wasting life? How much time do you still have in your life? That's why I want to creat this project, using precise numbers to remind people of the truth of life.

This project aims to build an individial life resume.
